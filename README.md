# Concept:

Hello! theLazyRedditor is an app that allows you to browse reddit with only your body!
Built on React with JavaScript, the app uses Tensorflow's machine learning models
to interpret your actions and allow you to intuitively browse reddit!

# Project Workflow:

## Actions from Tensorflow

1. Install and import necessary dependencies
Create React App
Tensorflow.js (@tensorflow/tfjs)
Handpose Models (@tensorflow-models/handpose)
React Webcam (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-webcam, react-webcam)

2. Setup a webcam stream to collect data

3. Define references to the webcam stream

4. Load handposes and define hand detection logic

5. Get utilities from Tensorflow

6. Create action outputs!

## Interpreting Actions

## Applying Actions to Reddit API


# Frequently Asked Questions:

#### Q: Why?
This project is a three-way combination of a Stackathon project from Fullstack Academy, 
inspiration from my brother in law, and my own desire to browse reddit from my bed.
